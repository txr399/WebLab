          <h4>Objective</h4>
          <p>

          </p>
          <h4><em>About Myself</em></h4>
          <p>
            I am a freshman currently attending the University of Miami. I am from Southeast, Washington, DC. In high school, I was involved in a lot of different sports and outside organizations. While at Miami, I hope to play a sport and join a lot of clubs and organizations. One of my main interests is coding. I find it very interesting to break down the basics of "talking to a computer".
