    <h4>How did Helen Keller contribute to society?</h4>
    <p> Helen Keller was a major fundraiser for the American Foundation for the Blind. Through these fundraising efforts, AFB continues to assist blind people in the areas of technology, education, independent living, literacy, and employment. Helen Keller also campaigned to make braille the standard system of reading and writing for people with vision loss. Earlier, four other systems were being used. This caused confusion and made it tough for people who were blind to communicate with each other. Thanks to Helen's work, braille became the standard system around the world in 1932.
      Helen Keller pushed the United States government for more assistance to the blind. In 1935, President Roosevelt signed the Social Security Act, which offered unemployment insurance, retirement funds, and assistance for children to the disabled. Thanks to Helen Keller's hard work, blind people were included in the category of "disabled," which meant they could apply for financial help. </p>
