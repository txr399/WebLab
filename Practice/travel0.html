              <h3>Rides</h3>
              <p>
              The rides at Magic Kingdom are fit for all ages. If you're looking for a thrill ride,
              I would recommend going on Space Mountian. Make sure to go early in the day before the lines get too long!
              One of my favorite rides that is often overlooked is the Monster's Inc. Laugh Floor. This consists of an interactive
              comedy show hosted by the monsters from Monsters Inc. If you're looking to cool off from the afternoon sun, Splash
              Mountain is my top choice. But make sure to get a fast pass for this one, the lines can get pretty long.
              </p>

              <h3>Entertainment</h3>
              <p>There is plenty to do at Magic Kingdom besides just rides. There are always character experiences throughout
              the park and a variety of shows for all ages. A short 15-20 minute live show occurs in front of Cinderella's castle
            throughout the day that features Mickey and friends. In the afternoon, there is the Festival of Fantasy Parade that goes
            through the park and finishes on Mainstreet U.S.A. At night, there's a fireworks show that you won't want to miss. But make
             sure to grab a spot early, firework viewing areas can get very packed. </p>

            <h3>Food</h3>
            <p>
              The food at Disney Parks is one of my favorite parts, especially for Magic Kingdom.
              Make sure to stop by Adventureland to grab a refreshing Dole Whip while you're there.
              Dole Whips are a pineapple ice cream treat that can be either eaten plain or as a float with
              pineapple juice added. If you're looking for a sit-down dining option, I would recommend Tony's Town Square Restaurant.
              The restaurant is themed on the movie Lady and the Tramp and features Italian dishes, including the spaghetti from the movie!
            </p>

              <h2>Epcot</h2>
              <h3>Rides</h3>
              <p>
                One of my favorite rides at Epcot is Test Track. You get to design your own car and then test out how it rides
                after you finish making it. When entering the park, don't be deceived by the large ball in the center of the park, it's not
                just for looks. There is actually a ride inside of it called Spaceship Earth. Another popular attraction is Soarin' which allows
                you to fly across the United States.
              </p>

              <h3>Entertainment</h3>
              <p>Around the World SHowcase, several different entertainers pop up for performances throughout the day. In the China Pavilion, the
                 Jeweled Dragon Acrobats put on a great show. In the France Pavilion, a man puts on a great balancing act with a stack of chairs.
                 At night, Epcot holds a show called the Epcot Forever which is presented on the lake in the middle of the World Showcase. The show uses
                a combination of light, water, boats, and fireworks to create an experience you won't want to miss. </p>

              <h3>Food</h3>
              <p>
                One of the best times to visit Epcot is during the Food and Wine Festival, which is held from the end of August through November 23rd.
                During this time there are extra food stands around Epcot along with celebrity chefs, and live concert performances. One of my favorite treats
                are the crepes in the France Pavilion. If you're looking for a sit-down meal, I would recommend getting pizza from the Via Napoli restaurant in Italy.
              </p>

              <h2>Hollywood Studios</h2>
              <h3>Rides</h3>
              <p>
                If you're looking for thrill rides, Hollywood Studios has two of the best ones. The Tower of Terror takes you to the haunted elevator of an abandoned
                 hotel from the golden age of Hollywood. The other is the Aerosmith Rock n' Rollercoaster which takes you from 0 to 60mph in 3 seconds. Both rides are
                 right next to each other and I would recommend hitting them early before the park gets too busy. Other popular areas that have just opened are Toy Story
                 Land and Star Wars: Galaxy's Edge which transport you into the world of the films.
              </p>

              </div>
              <h3>Entertainment</h3>
              <p>I believe Hollywood Studios provides some of the best entertainment options for live shows. Every day, there are showings of a live Beauty and the Beast
              play. There is also a live show called Indiana Jones Stunt Spectacular which is an interactive performance and gives a look behind the scenes
            of how stunts are performed for movies. At night, there is a show called Fantasmic that combines water, light, and pyrotechnics as you follow along Mickey's adventure. </p>

              <h3>Food</h3>
              <p>
                For a great sit-down dining option, I would recommend the Sci-Fi Dine-In Theater. It serves American food but has great theming for a fun family experience.
                If you're looking to try something different, I would head over to Star Wars: Galaxy's Edge and go to Docking Bay 7 Food and Cargo for Smoked Kaadu Ribs or some Fried Endorian Tip-yip.
                For a great afternoon snack, I would recommend getting a cream cheese-filled pretzel from the stand next to the Chinese Theater. It is one of the only places I have been able to find this type
                of pretzel in all of Disney World.
              </p>

              <h2>Animal Kingdom</h2>
              <h3>Rides</h3>
              <p>
                When you first enter the park, you may see a giant tree at the park's center. This
                is the tree of life, but don't be fooled, the tree isn't just for decoration. There is
                actually a Bug's Life themed ride inside of the tree that you can experience. Expedition Everest
                is one of the only roller coaster rides at Animal Kingdom, but it is also one of my favorites. The
                roller coaster goes through a mountain and you get to have a close-encounter experience with the Yeti
                 that lives inside of it. The newest addition to the park is the Pandora section, based on the Avatar movie.
                 I suggest going there first thing in the morning because the lines can get very long.

              <h3>Entertainment</h3>
              <p>Animal Kingdom has a few different performances that are put on throughout the day. Two of my favorites
              are Festival of the Lion King and Finding Nemo the Musical. Both are located indoors and are live performances
            that make you feel like you're having a broadway-level experience. Another new addition to Animal Kingdom in
          the River of Light night show. This is a performance that takes place on a body of water and combines light, music, and
        live actors to create a memorable experience.</p>

              <h3>Food</h3>
              <p>
                Although character dining experiences are available at locations in all the parks, my personal favorite is the brunch at Tusker House.
                At this character experience you'll run into Donald Duck along with Goofy, Daisy, Minnie, and Micky. The meal is provided buffet-style,
                so you can keep going back as much as you want. Another great option if you're eating on-the-go is the BBQ pulled pork mac n' cheese from Eight
                Spoon Cafe. for a sweet treat, go to Dino Bite Snacks and try the Scrooge McDuck Billionaire Sundae.

            <h3>Value: Pop Century</h3>
            <p>
              The Pop Century Resort is the best value level resort on Disney property. The location is more centrally located to the parks than
              the other value resorts and provides a variety of amenities. There are several pools on the property and it sits right next to a lake.
              If you want, you could take a short walk across the bridge to visit the Disney Art of Animation Resort. While staying here, you definitely
              are reminded you're on Disney property with the larger-than-life statues of Disney characters through the decades that are scattered around the hotel.

            <h3>Moderate: Port Orleans French Quarter</h3>
            <p>The Port Orleans French Quarter Resort is by far my favorite hotel that I have stayed at. The resort is located right beside the
            river and guests are able to take a relaxing boat ride down the river to Disney Springs, the shopping district at Walt Disney World.
            One of my favorite parts about the resort is that they offer beignets on the restaurant menu. This is one of the only places at the Walt
            Disney World Resort where you can get them. Overall, this hotel has a elegant style and relaxing feel that makes it feel more like a getaway while
            still being more affordable than the Deluxe Resorts.</p>

              The Polynesian Resort takes guests to an island paradise. The hotel connects with the monorail system which can take guests quickly to the Magic Kingdom,
              Epcot, or any other resort that connects to the monorail. The resort also features it's own character dining experience where you can interact with Lilo and Stitch,
              along with other classic Disney characters. Overall, this is definitely one of the higher class options, making it more expensive, but depending on your budget,
              the Polynesian Resort could be the perfect fit for you.
